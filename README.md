### 🎛️ Modifying Settings & Filters
No complex configuration needed — just control your Agent through natural conversation. For example:
- "Show me AI videos released by top KOLs in the past 5 days"
- "Give me today's AI news, but exclude TechReview"
- "Fetch Reddit AI discussions from the past 3 days"

The agent automatically understands your intent and translates it into precise filtering conditions. You can control:

- 📂 **Filter by Category** — Include or exclude content types: News, Open Source, Social Discussions, KOL Insights
- 📡 **Filter by Source** — Include or exclude specific platforms (e.g., Reddit, TechCrunch, etc.)
- ⏰ **Time Range** — Customize how far back to fetch (default: past 24 hours)
- 🔢 **Result Limit** — Control the number of items returned (effective cap depends on tier: guest 3 / logged-in 6 / member 100)
- 📝 **Summary Display** — Choose whether to show short summaries, long summaries
- 🔗 **Link Display** — Choose whether to show original article links
- 🌐 **Language** — Choose output language (English or Chinese). Defaults to your system language; falls back to English if neither
- 💾 **Output Format** — Results can be printed directly to the terminal or exported as a JSON file
